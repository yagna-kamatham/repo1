hello yagna, this is shann. I am here to help you out with making a delicious biryani. 
The proocess is quite simple.
Open your uber eats app and selece the indian restaurents.
Now, choose the restaurent which has a rating above 4.5.
Half of the work is done. Now simply go to that selected restaurent menu and select the type of biryani you need. 
Now make the payment and order it to the desired location.
Thank me later :)
